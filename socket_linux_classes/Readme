This task was completed as part of the entrance test. The program implemented the creation of multithreading, string processing and data transfer between applications using sockets.
In the first implementation, the program sends data to another program and cleans the buffer regardless of its connection. The second implementation checks if there is a connection.
If the second program is closed in an emergency, a reconnection error may occur, which can be corrected by adding a listening stream that detects a connection break. However, this was not done due to the limitation of the number of threads in a particular task.
